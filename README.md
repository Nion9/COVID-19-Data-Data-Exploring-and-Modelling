COVID-19 Data Analysis Project
This repository contains a comprehensive R-based analysis of COVID-19 data, covering data wrangling, exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and dashboard design. Developed by Minhajul Islam Nion, a final-year Bachelor of Information Technology student at the University of Canberra, this project showcases skills in data analysis, visualization, and statistical modelingâ€”key competencies for data analyst roles.
Overview
The project is divided into four tasks:

Task 1: Data preparation and wrangling, including merging datasets (Countries.csv, Covid19.csv, Recovered.csv, Tests.csv) and adding variables like cumulative cases, active cases, and per-million rates.
Task 2: Exploratory data analysis, including global death toll trends, visualizations of cases/deaths/recoveries, and rankings of countries by metrics.
Task 3: Data-driven modeling, featuring linear regression, Ridge/Lasso regression, and decision trees to predict cumulative cases, with performance comparisons.
Task 4: Insights and dashboard design, proposing an expanded dataset and a user-friendly dashboard to highlight pandemic trends and impacts.

Files

Task1.R: Script for data preparation and wrangling (Task 1).
Task2.R: Script for exploratory data analysis (Task 2).
Task3.R: Script for predictive modeling (Task 3).
Task4.R: Script for dashboard design report and insights (Task 4).
Countries.csv, Covid19.csv, Recovered.csv, Tests.csv: Input datasets (required for execution).
dashboard.png: Visual representation of the proposed COVID-19 dashboard (included in the zip folder).

Setup Instructions

Install R and RStudio:

Download and install R (https://cran.r-project.org/) and RStudio (https://posit.co/downloads/).


Install Required Packages:Run the following in R to install dependencies:
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "lubridate", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "corrplot", "caret", "glmnet", "rpart", "Metrics"))


Download Datasets:

Place Countries.csv, Covid19.csv, Recovered.csv, and Tests.csv in the project directory. These can be sourced from public health repositories (e.g., WHO, Johns Hopkins) if not provided.


Run the Scripts:

Open each .R file in RStudio and run the code sequentially. Ensure the working directory is set to the project folder:setwd("path/to/your/project")





Usage

Task 1: Execute Task1.R to load, merge, and wrangle the data into a master dataframe with new variables (e.g., CumCases, Active, FatalityRate).
Task 2: Run Task2.R to perform exploratory analysis, generating plots (e.g., global cumulative trends, top 10 country comparisons).
Task 3: Use Task3.R to train and compare regression models (linear, Ridge, Lasso, decision tree) for predicting cumulative cases.
Task 4: Review Task4.R for the dashboard design report, including proposed expansions and visualizations (see dashboard.png).

Output

Plots: Saved as PNG files (e.g., covid_cases_line.png, covid_cases_bar.png) in the working directory.
Tables: Model performance comparisons (e.g., RMSE, R-squared) printed in the console or R Markdown output.
Dashboard: A conceptual design in dashboard.png, detailing global trends, regional impacts, and healthcare strain.
